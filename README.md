### Me ðŸ‘‹
- Hi, Iâ€™m @donthescot, or Don for short.
- Iâ€™m interested in all sorts of tech, motorbikes, and being Dad to three girls and a Cavoodle.

### Personal Projects ðŸ˜„
- Home automation is my thing.  I'm continuing to tinker and develop my setup on Home Assistant, recently adding AI into the mix.
