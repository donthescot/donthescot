### Me ðŸ‘‹
- Hi, Iâ€™m @donthescot, or Don for short.
- Iâ€™m interested in all sorts of tech, motorbikes, and being Dad to two girls and a Cavoodle.

### My Work ðŸ‘·
- I'm a Senior Project Manager in APAC Expert Services working with amazingly talented people.
- Our team enable customers to unleash the power of GitHub's platform and products.
- Reach me on donthescot@github.com.

### Personal Projects ðŸ˜„
- I've just rebuilt my Home Automation platform using Home Assistant; one of the largest and most popular open-source projects - all built on GitHub.  I'm using Apple's HomeKit as a frontend but unleashing the power of HA as the brains.
